A basic recipe website

The current project requires students to create a recipe website that includes a home page with links to tree different recipes. The project utilizes HTML skills learned in the HTML section of The Odin Project's Foundations course. In order to complete the project, students must use git, GitHub, HTML boilerplate, headings, images, links, and ordered and unordered lists successfully.
